Jake Hildreth is a man of many titles: husband, dad, Principal Security Consultant at Semperis, Microsoft MVP, and longtime IT survivor with the scars to prove it. For 25 years, he’s been wrangling Active Directory, battling the chaos of Certificate Services, and creating open-source tools to make identity security suck less. When he’s not untangling Kerberos or wrestling DNS, he’s hanging out with his favorite reality check: his wife and daughter.
