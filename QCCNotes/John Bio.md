John Askew is an offensive security tester, software engineer, and occasional public speaker. Currently leading a red team service line at Dean Dorton, he has worked in offensive security since 2007, and has more recently gained an interest in vulnerability research and network MITM attacks. One time he even found a vulnerability in Microsoft Kerberos. Still, he might or might not have any idea what he is doing... attend his talk and you can decide for yourself.
